This is a  Reddit Clone app. 

Functionality includes:
* User sign-in/up
* Submit a link
* Upvote/downvote
* Commenting

Used a few gems for this functionality including
* Devise -> user accounts
* Bootstrap -> enhanced UI
* acts_as_votable -> up/down voting
* simpleform -> commenting

It was a challenge, but fun!
